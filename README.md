🖼️ Image Processing & Feature Extraction

This repository contains implementations of classical computer vision techniques using Python and OpenCV. It focuses on fundamental image processing and feature extraction methods that are widely used in computer vision pipelines.

Implemented Methods:

Canny Edge Detection – for detecting edges and boundaries in images.

Otsu’s Thresholding – for automatic image binarization.

HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) – for feature extraction used in object detection and recognition.

These tasks provide a foundation for understanding more advanced deep learning-based computer vision models.
